# mp4_video_generation
While it is easy to save images in python into png or tiff, it is more difficult to save an image stack into a video format. Especially if you need to compress it as so often is required for scientific publication (usually with a maximum size limit of 5-20 MB). This package makes it easy to save image stacks in numpy arrays into mp4-files. Multiple features are included: timestamp, scale bar, text on the video, and adding several image stacks in parallel into a video.
